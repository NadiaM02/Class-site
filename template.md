## Bandwidth
When developing a website bandwidth is one one of the most important components. Bandwidth is the amount of data and level of traffic that is transferred between the site users and the internet. The benefits of more bandwidth is that it allows more users on a site at one time and makes the site easier to use. Three things that bandwidth can improve are as follows:

 - Networks
 - Connections
 - and Systems

The more complex a website is the more bandwidth is needed. The amount of images, files, videos and sound files the more complicated a page is and the more bandwidth is needed. Calculating how much bandwidth a site will need is easy. First you would add up all the file sizes of each component of your site and then adding it to the total amount of traffic, that is expected on your site, within a month. If you use FTP to transfer files to a website, than this needs to be added in your calculations.
## Storage
Storage is the amount of web space that is given from hosting companies to website owners. Storage refers to the total amount of text files, image files, databases, emails and other files important to a website. This space also allows file information on the web and to the whole world. There are also invisible files.These are important on-site activities such as order form processing that helps with online stores and pull result management. In turn databases store data like product codes and customer details.



## Backups
Along with storage and bandwidth, backups are very important when developing a website. Backups are a snapshot of all the important information and elements of a website. Things that are included in the backups are as follows: Website code files, website databases, images, and any add-ons, plugins or themes used by a website. Ways to backup a website include:

- Web Hosting service - The website host will offer a backup service as an option.
- Web Developer - If a web developer designed your website they may have prepared a backup.
- The Cloud- a plugin that uses the a cloud based service can be installed and used to store important backup files.
- Files to Your Computer - Make a copy of your website files and have a web developer provide a ZIP file for your site.
